# Microsoft 365 Integration

Connect Claude Code to Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Calendar, OneDrive, Teams, SharePoint, etc.)

## What It Does

- **Outlook** - Read, send, and manage emails
- **Calendar** - View and create events
- **OneDrive** - Access and manage files
- **Teams** - Read channels and messages
- **SharePoint** - Access sites and documents
- **To Do** - Manage tasks
- **OneNote** - Access notebooks
- **Planner** - View and manage plans

## Who It's For

Anyone using Microsoft 365 for work or personal productivity who wants Claude to help manage emails, calendar, and files.

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft account (personal or work/school)
- Node.js installed (`npx` available)
- For work/school accounts: Your organization may require admin consent (see Troubleshooting)

## Setup

```bash
./.marvin/integrations/ms365/setup.sh
```

The setup script will prompt for:
- **Scope** — user-scoped (all projects) or project-scoped
- **Account type** — work/school or personal only
- **Tool preset** — all tools or essentials (mail, calendar, files)

## Authentication

Uses Microsoft's device flow authentication:
1. Run `claude mcp` and select 'ms365'
2. Choose 'Authenticate'
3. Visit the URL shown and enter the device code
4. Sign in with your Microsoft account
5. Tokens are cached for future sessions

No API keys or client secrets required.

## Account Types

The `--org-mode` flag enables both:
- Work/School accounts (Microsoft 365 Business)
- Personal Microsoft accounts (outlook.com, hotmail.com)

## Try It

After setup, try these in Claude:

- "What's on my Outlook calendar today?"
- "Show my recent emails"
- "What files are in my OneDrive?"

## Danger Zone

This integration can perform actions that affect others or can't be easily undone:

| Action | Risk Level | Who's Affected |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Send emails | High | Recipients see immediately |
| Delete emails | High | May be unrecoverable |
| Create/modify calendar events | Medium | Other attendees notified |
| Delete files | High | Data loss may be permanent |
| Read emails/files | Low | No external impact |

MARVIN will always confirm before performing high-risk actions.

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to connect" error:**
- Run `claude mcp remove ms365 -s user` and re-run setup
- Make sure Node.js is installed

**Authentication issues / stuck in a loop:**
1. Run `claude mcp` in your terminal
2. Find 'ms365' in the list and select it
3. Choose 'Authenticate'
4. Complete the device flow in your browser

If that doesn't work, clear cached tokens: `rm -rf ~/.ms365-mcp/`

**"Need admin approval" error (Work/School accounts):**

This MCP requests broad permissions including Teams, SharePoint, and directory access. Many organizations require admin consent for these scopes.

Your options:
1. **Get admin consent** - Ask your IT admin to approve the app, or grant yourself admin rights if you're an admin
2. **Use a personal Microsoft account** - Personal accounts (outlook.com, hotmail.com) don't require admin consent
3. **Wait for a minimal-scopes version** - A fork with reduced permissions for just Mail, Calendar, and OneDrive is being considered

Scopes that typically require admin consent:
- `User.Read.All`, `Sites.Read.All`, `Files.Read.All`
- All Teams/Chat scopes (`Team.ReadBasic.All`, `Channel.ReadBasic.All`, etc.)

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
# Work/school account, all tools
claude mcp add ms365 -s user -- npx -y @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server --org-mode

# Work/school account, essentials only (may avoid admin consent)
claude mcp add ms365 -s user -- npx -y @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server --org-mode --preset mail,calendar,files

# Personal account only
claude mcp add ms365 -s user -- npx -y @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server
```

Available flags (run `--help` for full list):
- `--org-mode` — enable work/school accounts
- `--preset <tools>` — limit to specific tools (mail, calendar, files, teams, etc.)
- `--read-only` — disable write operations
